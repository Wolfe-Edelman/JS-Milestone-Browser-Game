<h1 align="center">Welcome to BlackJack 21, the National League East edition!</h1>
<h2 align="center">If you enjoy casino games and want to explore the world of East Coast Major League Baseball, then you have come to the right place!</h2>
<p align="center">The name of the game is to get the sum of of all the card values in your current hand to equal 21.
If you exceed 21, you lose the hand.
This is a multiplayer game, specifically the user vs. the dealer, in this case the computer.
Whoever gets closer to 21 without exceeding will be the winner of the hand.
In order to begin a round, you must hit the button "Hit" in order for you, the active player names 'Player', to receive the first card.
After receiving a card, you will have the opportunity to have the dealer provide you with another card, by pressing the button 'Hit' again. You may hit until you have exceeded the sum of 21.
If you wish to remain with the current cards dealt, you hit the button 'Hold'.
Once you have hit the 'Hold' button, each opponent's cards will be revealed. 
If the player exceeds 21, they automatically lose, and it is called a 'Bust'.
If the player is closer to but either below or equal to 21, then the player wins.
If the dealer is closer to but either below or equal to 21, then the house wins and the player loses.
If the player and dealer reveal the same sum of cards for any given hand, or they both bust, then the outcome is a tie, or draw.

Values of cards:
2-10 = the numerical value displayed on the card.
A = 1 or 11, depending on the active player's discretion.
J,K,Q = 10

Suits have no hierarchy, except in sentimental value to players; the suits go as follows: Philadelphia's Philly Fanatic, New York's Mr. Met, Atlanta's Blooper, and Miami's Billy the Marlin. Hopefully your favorite Major League Baseball National League East mascot will lead you to victory, or perhaps a rival's mascot will do the same. May the strongest mascot's hand win!</p>
